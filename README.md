# nas-system
This project is a lightweight, self-built NAS system based on Raspberry Pi 5. It includes a custom web interface for file management, system monitoring, and automated backups. Designed to be easy to set up and use - no commercial software, just clean Java + Spring Boot on the backend and React on the frontend.
